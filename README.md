PGP Contact for Wordpress
=========================

This plugin uses the openpgp.js libraries to provide users with the ability to upload PGP public keys and later use them for encryption of contact forms. The plugin currently provides a form tag to Contact Forms 7 to this end.

Uploading a Key
---------------

Once the plugins has been installed, users may navigate to the new `Your PGP Key` menu item to upload their personal keys.

Encrypting with Contact Forms 7
-------------------------------

Once both this plugin and Contact Forms 7 have been installed, you can add an encrypt button to a form using the Contact Forms. 

This functionality will use the public key of the author of the page or post containing the contact form.
